## Objectives

1. Practice writing reducers

## Instructions

It's time to build out some reducers. We're developing an app that allows you to write a list of ingredients to buy at the store.

Write your code in ```src/reducers/index/js```

Some notes:
- Reducers take in two arguments: state and action
- Reducers must pure
- For this application, your state should default to an empty array
- Your reducer should be able to handle
    - Unknown actions
    - An `'ADD_INGREDIENT'` action
    - A  `'REMOVE_INGREDIENT'` action

In terms of functionality, a user should be able to add an ingredient and remove it by clicking on it. Use the tests as a guide. We've built out the components and relevant actions. Once you're passing the tests, run `npm run start` to see your app in action!
